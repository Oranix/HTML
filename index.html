		<h3> So i am 30 years old from Kiryat Motzkin. Married and the father of an amazing one and a half year old girl. i'm currently works full time in the field of testing as a V&V engineer in the R&D department in a global company of medical devices for the aesthetic field. In terms of my education, I studied at the Technion for practical Electronics Engineering and graduated in 2020. As of today, I am in my third job in my career after that i decided that i need to learn more skills. <br> really like the world of testing that also includes hardware but mostly software. 
		<br>Im very connected to the world of testing (QA) and also code writing and development, a combination of automation tests and manual testing can definitely improve the company's products and give me more tools to the team i work with and for me more skills for my carrer.</h3>
