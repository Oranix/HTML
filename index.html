		<h3> So I am 30 years old from Kiryat Motzkin. Married and father of an amazing one and a half year old girl. Today I work full-time in the testing field as a V&V engineer in the R&D department in a global company of medical devices for the aesthetic field. In terms of my education, I studied at the Technion for electronics engineering and graduated in 2020. As of today, I am in my third job in my career, after that I decided that I needed to learn more skills. <br> I really like the world of testing which also includes hardware but mostly software.
		<br>(QA) and also writing code and development, my practical experience in development was in the final project where we developed the product in the C language. The combination of manual testing and automation can definitely improve the company's products and give me more tools for the team I work with.</h3>
